The countries belonging the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe & Central Asia share the most similarities with other countries within their own regions. Both these regions have experienced a relatively small change in age dependency, while most other regions seem to have undergone a more significant decrease in age dependency. Globally, all countries experienced an increase in life expectancy, with Europe & Central Asia in particular having experienced the smallest change.

```

On average, high income countries have experienced the smallest increase while lower middle income countries have experienced the greatest increase on average in terms of life expectancy.

All income groups seem to have a similar spread of change in fertility rate, though high income countries seem to have several countries with exceptionally low values from the MENA region. Otherwise, the low income countries look similar lower middle income, though with a slightly higher change in population growth rate and consisting primarily of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
