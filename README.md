# Global Health and Demographic Indicators Analysis

## Introduction

This project explores relationships between key public health indicators and population dynamics using data from the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Our analysis focuses on how demographic, health, and fertility-related metrics interact across different countries, regions, and income levels. We use SQL for data processing and Python for statistical visualization and analysis.
