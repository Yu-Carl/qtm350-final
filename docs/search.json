The regions of Europe & Central Asia as well as East Asia & Pacific, primarily made up of HICs and LMICs, have experienced the smallest declines in adolescent fertility rate from. Otherwise, the rest of the regions and economic statuses emcompass a relatively wide range of changes, albeit negative, in both metrics.\n\nTo investigate trends population growth, we plotted a distribution of change in population growth rates according to countries’ income level, independent of region1.\nOn average, low income countries have the experienced the highest change population growth rates, and is the only income group that experienced a positive change in population growth rates. High, upper middle, and lower middle income countries all experienced negative changes in population growth rates from 1961-2023, with upper middle income countries on average having the greatest decline in population growth.\n\nAll income groups seem to have a similar spread of change in adolescent fertility rate with most countries experiencing a decline in fertility rate since 1960, though several high income countries from the MENA region seem have experienced exceptionally large drops. Otherwise, the overall trends exhibited low income countries are relatively similar that of lower-middle income countries, though low-middle income countries on average have experienced a slight decrease in their population growth rates as well as adolescent fertility rates.\nA systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2017 on near-global population and fertility patterns discovered that fertility rates for ages 15-19 tend to decrease as countries develop, though countries with similar socio-demographic index scores also exhibited drastically different adolescent fertility rates (Murray et al. 2018). Using income status as an rough indicator of development and assuming that countries have undergone development from the 1960s to 2023, it would be plausible for low income and low-middle income countries to exhibit the most significant decreases in adolescent fertility rate. This trend seems to be largely supported by our data, where high income countries have experienced a smaller decrease on average in terms of adolescent fertility rates relative to both low income and low-middle income countries, which have more significant decreases. At the same time, due to demographic transition, low income countries have experienced the largest increase in ppopulation growth rates. High income countries also have the second highest change in population growth (albeit still negative), which is not necessarily attributed to high adolescent fertility rates. As adolescent births are just a facet of a country’s overall population growth, high income countries’ increase in population growth rates can likely be attributed to not only births by older adults, but also to other phenomena such as the arrival of migrants countries belonging to different income statuses."

    "text": "This project investigates the relationships between public health and population dynamics using World Bank data to reveal patterns across regions and income levels. Focusing on three indicator pairs, we analyze how demographic and health factors interact, including adolescent fertility rate and population growth, age dependency ratio and life expectancy at birth, and births attended by skilled health staff and infant mortality rates.\nBoth pairs 1 and 2 supported trends across countries of different income groups, attributed to phenomena associated with demographic transition. Low income countries have experienced the greatest decreases in adolescent fertility rates but also the largest increase in population growth rates. This highlights the fact that fertility rates in not adolescents, but older population as well as a country’s overall improvements in areas such as access to food, healthcare, sanitation, and economic development. Likewise, the more pronounced decreases in dependency ratios lower-middle and upper-middle income countries as they transition to highly developed economies reflect a shift in the demographics working class to older groups, as well as also having a more pronounced increase in life expectancy as opposed to highly developed countries, where life expectancy is already approaching its human limits. These indicators and their trajectories aren’t necessarily the sole cause of one another, but are intertwined with and influence one another and change accordingly with a country’s point along demographic transition into highly developed economies.\nFor pair 3, the analysis shows that increased skilled birth attendance is strongly associated with declines in infant mortality globally, with significant progress in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia despite ongoing disparities. A systematic review of 41 African countries demonstrated that a 10% increase in skilled birth attendance corresponded with a 6% reduction in neonatal mortality, highlighting the critical impact of skilled healthcare during childbirth on infant survival (Berhan and Berhan 2014). Similarly, a national survey in Lesotho found that births not attended by skilled health personnel had twice the risk of neonatal death compared to those with skilled attendants, directly supporting the finding that increased skilled birth attendance is linked to lower infant mortality rates (Baruwa, Amoateng, and Mkwananzi 2021).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBaruwa, Ololade Julius, Acheampong Yaw Amoateng, and Sibusiso Mkwananzi. 2021. “Association Between Type of Birth Attendants and Neonatal Mortality: Evidence from a National Survey.” African Health Sciences 21 (4): 1870–76.\n\n\nBerhan, Yifru, and Asres Berhan. 2014. “Skilled Health Personnel Attended Delivery as a Proxy Indicator for Maternal and Perinatal Mortality: A Systematic Review.” Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences 24: 69–80."

Our goal is to understand how certain demographic, health, and fertility-related measures are related, and what patterns emerge across different regions or income levels over time.\n\n\nData Description\nTo guide our analysis, we grouped six indicators into three pairs:\n\nAdolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19) and population growth (annual %) to explore how youth fertility might contribute to overall population change.\n\n\nAdolescent fertility rate serves as an indicator of reproductive health and education access.\nPopulation growth reflects demographic shifts and may be influenced by fertility trends.\n\n\nAge dependency ratio (% of working-age population) and life expectancy at birth (years) to understand how population age structure relates to general health and longevity.\n\n\nAge dependency ratio measures the economic burden on the working population.\nLife expectancy is a common proxy for overall population health.\n\n\nBirths attended by skilled health staff (% of total) and infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) to assess how healthcare access during childbirth impacts early-life survival.\n\n\nSkilled birth attendance indicates healthcare quality and accessibility during delivery.\nInfant mortality rate reflects child health outcomes and overall healthcare effectiveness.\n\nBy integrating SQL for data cleaning and transformation and Python for visualization and modeling, we aim to show meaningful patterns and trends within these pairs. Our analysis also considers regional and income-level differences where relevant. Through this approach, we hope to provide insights into how social and healthcare factors contribute to broader population and health outcomes worldwide."
