    "text": "Pair 1: Adolescent Fertility Rate (births per 1000 women ages 15-19) and Population Growth (annual %)\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nWe first plotted the change for all countries across all region and income statuses for adolescent fertility rate and population from 1960-2023, with each point representing a country to provide a broad visualization and see if there are any overall trends.\nAt the global level, both adolescent fertility rate and population growth have been declining from 1960-2023. The regions of Europe & Central Asia as well as East Asia & Pacific, primarily made up of HICs and LMICs, have experienced the smallest declines in adolescent fertility rate from. Otherwise, the rest of the regions and economic statuses emcompass a relatively wide range of changes, albeit negative, in both metrics.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nTo investigate trends population growth, we plotted a distribution of change in population growth rates according to countries’ income level, independent of region1.\nOn average, low income countries have the experienced the highest change population growth rates, and is the only income group that experienced a positive change in population growth rates. High, upper middle, and lower middle income countries all experienced negative changes in population growth rates from 1961-2023, with upper middle income countries on average having the greatest decline in population growth.\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nAll income groups seem to have a similar spread of change in adolescent fertility rate with most countries experiencing a decline in fertility rate since 1960, though several high income countries from the MENA region seem have experienced exceptionally large drops. Otherwise, the overall trends exhibited low income countries are relatively similar that of lower-middle income countries, though low-middle income countries on average have experienced a slight decrease in their population growth rates as well as adolescent fertility rates.\nA systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2017 on near-global population and fertility patterns discovered that fertility rates for ages 15-19 tend to decrease as countries develop, though countries that have similar socio-demographic index scores can also exhibit drastically different adolescent fertility rates (Murray et al. 2018). Using income status as an rough indicator of development and assuming that countries have undergone development from the 1960s to 2023, it would be plausible for low income and low-middle income countries to exhibit the most significant decreases in adolescent fertility rate. This trend seems to be largely supported by our data, where high income countries have experienced a smaller decrease on average in terms of adolescent fertility rates relative to both low income and low-middle income countries, which have more significant decreases. At the same time, due to demographic transition, low income countries have experienced the largest increase in ppopulation growth rates. High income countries also have the second highest change in population growth (albeit still negative), which is not necessarily attributed to high adolescent fertility rates, but likely due to other phenomena such as the arrival of migrants from low/low-middle income countries."

    "text": "Pair 3: Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total) and infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nTo explore the relationship between maternal healthcare access and infant survival outcomes, we plotted the change in births attended by skilled health staff against the change in infant mortality rates between 2000 and 2019.\nEach point in the scatterplot represents a region, color-coded.\nWe used the following metrics:\n\nX-axis: Change in the percentage of births attended by skilled health staff (%)\nY-axis: Change in infant mortality (per 1,000 live births)\n\nThis visual helps assess whether increases in skilled birth attendance are associated with better infant health outcomes, and whether this trend is consistent across regions.\nMany countries that experienced an increase in skilled birth attendance from 2000 to 2019 also saw a decrease in infant mortality (or greater change in infant mortality), especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asia & Pacific. This suggests a negative correlation: as more births are attended by skilled health staff, fewer infants die.\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nTo understand trends in infant survival across global regions, we plotted average infant mortality rates from 2000 to 2019.\nEach line represents a different world region, showing changes in infant deaths per 1,000 live births over time.\nKey insights from this visualization include:\n\nAll regions experienced a decline in infant mortality rates over the 20-year period.\nSub-Saharan Africa had the highest rates throughout, though it also saw significant improvement—from around 80 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to below 50 by 2019.\nSouth Asia also made significant progress closing the gap with regions that have lower infant mortality rates.\nRegions like Europe & Central Asia and North America maintained the lowest infant mortality rates, with steady improvements, though the overall changes were smaller.\n\nThese patterns reflect global progress in child health and survival, while highlighting persistent disparities across regions. The overall downward trend is consistent with increased access to healthcare and maternal services observed during this time.\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nTo track improvements in maternal healthcare access globally, we visualized the average percentage of births attended by skilled health staff across world regions from 2000 to 2019.\nEach line represents a region, illustrating how skilled birth attendance has evolved over time.\nKey insights from the figure include:\n\nRegions like Europe & Central Asia and North America consistently maintained near-universal skilled birth attendance, with rates close to 100% .\nEast Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, and Middle East & North Africa also exhibited high and relatively stable skilled birth rates, typically above 90%.\nSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which started with the lowest skilled birth attendance rates in 2000, showed substantial improvement over the two decades. South Asia, in particular, saw an increase from around 35% to over 70%.\n\nThe upward trends in these regions reflect significant investments in maternal health services and broader healthcare access.\nThis visualization highlights regional disparities in maternal healthcare but also showcases meaningful global progress, particularly in regions with historically lower access to skilled care during childbirth."
